<h1> What Does High-Level Language (HLL) Mean?</h1><hr>
<p> A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.</p><br>
<p>A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.</p>
